<h1>Mac and Cheese Instructions</h1>
<p> Preheat the oven. Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.
Cook the macaroni. Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.
Make the roux.  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.
Add milk and cheese.  Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.
Pour into baking dish.  Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Â½ cup cheese over the top. Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</p>
